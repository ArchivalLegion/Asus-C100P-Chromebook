Webcam notes
- it takes a while to load after boot and then after an application exits it seems like it stays locked
- I'm not sure what /dev/media0 is supposed to be but it had some webcam stuff listed in the attributes
- messenger still does not work in facebook
- cheese and guvcview would crash... maybe I didn't give it enough time to load
- the video needs to be mirrored (maybe this can be done at an application level)

# What about other udev rules that may be conflicting???
#
# to search the contents of files for conflicting rules
# grep video *.rules
# 50-udev-default.rules:SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", GROUP="video"
# 60-persistent-v4l.rules:SUBSYSTEM!="video4linux", GOTO="persistent_v4l_end"
# 60-persistent-v4l.rules:KERNEL=="video*", ENV{ID_SERIAL}=="?*", SYMLINK+="v4l/by-id/$env{ID_BUS}-$env{ID_SERIAL}-video-index$attr{index}"
# 60-persistent-v4l.rules:ENV{ID_PATH}=="?*", KERNEL=="video*|vbi*", SYMLINK+="v4l/by-path/$env{ID_PATH}-video-index$attr{index}"
# 70-uaccess.rules:SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", TAG+="uaccess"
# 70-uaccess.rules:# DRI video devices
# 95-cd-devices.rules:# video cameras
#
# Okay so you can try just changing the priority of the udev rule if that doesn't work you can try commenting out the rules above that may be conflicting
# changing the priority would be the easiest first step. Not entirely sure what it could be
# remember it could just be a glitchy driver !!!
