# Asus-C100P-Chromebook
My ongoing experience installing arch linux on an end of life chromebook

This project is designed to install archlinux on an ASUS C100P chromebook.

My goals for this project are:
1) Security - ChromeOS on this device is no longer being updated. When I am not on my home wifi I want to be able to connect to a vpn using wireguard.
2) Privacy - I want to move away from the google ecosystem. Firefox is my browser of choice and I want to stick with open source apps when possible.
3) Hardware - I want to have all of the hardware working properly.
4) Applications - GUI with Web browser, Word Processor, Zoom (for work meetings)

The Install process is broken down into several stages:
1) Preparing the SD Card for a linux computer or the ChromeOS partition of the chrombook.
2) Initializing pacman, updating, and running bug fixes.
3) Configuring hardware and users
4) Installing a GUI and base applications

The next steps of the project are:
1) Install a Samba filesharing client
2) Install wireguard vpn when I am not on my home network
3) Install zoom for video calls
