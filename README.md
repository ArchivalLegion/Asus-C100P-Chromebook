# Asus-C100P-Chromebook
My ongoing experience installing arch linux on an end of life chromebook

This project is designed to install archlinux on an ASUS C100P chromebook.

I broke the process down into several stages:
1) Preparing the SD Card for a linux computer or the ChromeOS partition of the chrombook.
2) Initializing pacman, updating, and running bug fixes.
3) Configuring hardware and users
4) Installing a GUI and base applications

The next steps of the project are:
1) Install a Samba filesharing client
2) Install wireguard vpn when I am not on my home network
3) Install zoom for video calls
